# S-expression-calculator
 command line program that acts as a simple calculator: it takes a single argument as an expression and prints out the integer result of evaluating it.


Currently one add and multiply operations are supported, but other operations can be added later on. 

Examples:

"(add 1 (multiply 5 3))"
=> 16

"(multiply 2 (add (multiply 2 4) 8))"
=> 32
